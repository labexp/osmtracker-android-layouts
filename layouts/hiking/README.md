# Hiking layout

This layout is for hiking in nature in semi-developed areas (and
perhaps is useful for other foot travel).  It has properties of both
trails and other infrastructure (signs, picnic, fires, shelters, etc).

The basic idea:
- Basic types of ways
- Additional properties of ways (surfaces, difficulty, symbols)
- Things along the way (while walking, and also sites)
- Water
- Roads (mainly focused on trailheads)
