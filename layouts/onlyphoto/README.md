## Onlyphoto layout
This "layout" consists of a single, big camera button and is designed for just taking photos and mapping later at home.
It is extremely useful when handling the phone with one hand while hiking, when there is no time for detailed data collection anyway.
To reduce the neccessary interaction even further, set the standard picture source to "camera" in OSMTracker.
